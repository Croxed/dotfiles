| Option | Effect |
| ------ | ----------- |
| AUTO_CD | If the typed command is invalid, but is a directory, cd to that directory |
| AUTO_PUSHD | After cd, push the old directory to the directory stack |
| PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS | Don't push multiple copies of the same directory to the stack |
| PUSHD_SILENT | Don't print the directory after pushd or popd |
| PUSHD_TO_HOME | pushd without arguments acts like 'pushd ${HOME}' |
| EXTENDED_GLOB | Treat '#', '~', and '^' as patterns for filename globbing |
| MULTIOS | Performs implicit tees or cats when using redirections |
| CLOBBER | Disables automatic truncation with '>' or '>\|'. Use '>>!' or '>>\|' instead |
