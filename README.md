Installation
------------
Installing Zim is easy. If you have a different shell framework installed (like oh-my-zsh or prezto),
*uninstall those first to prevent conflicts*. It can be installed manually by following the instructions below:

1. In a Zsh shell, clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eriner/zim.git ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim
  ```

2. Paste this into your terminal to prepend the initialization templates to your configs:
  ```
  setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
  for template_file ( ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim/templates/* ); do
    user_file="${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.${template_file:t}"
    touch ${user_file}
    ( print -rn "$(<${template_file})$(<${user_file})" >! ${user_file} ) 2>/dev/null
  done
  ```

3. Set Zsh as the default shell:
  ```
  chsh -s =zsh
  ```

4. Open a new terminal and finish optimization (this is only needed once, hereafter it will happen upon desktop/tty login):
  ```
  source ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zlogin
  ```

5. You're done! Enjoy your Zsh IMproved! Take some time to read about the [available modules][modules] and tweak your `.zshrc` file.

Updating
--------

To update zim, run:

```
zmanage update
```

For more information about the `zmanage` tool, see the [meta module][meta-module] documentation.

Uninstalling
------------

The best way to remove zim is to manually delete `~/.zim`, `~/.zimrc`, and
remove the initialization lines from your `~/.zshrc`.

However, there are some **experimental** convenience functions to remove zim:
