# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# It is strongly recommended to keep all shell customization and configuration
# (including exported environment variables such as PATH) in ~/.zshrc or in
# files sourced from ~/.zshrc. If you are certain that you must export some
# environment variables in ~/.zshenv, do it where indicated by comments below.
